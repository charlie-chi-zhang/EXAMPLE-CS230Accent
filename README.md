# Accent Transfer of English Speech
## CS230 Winter 2018, Lily Chen, Laura Shen, Meng Tang

A convolutional neural network that classifies audio of English speech based on accent as "native" or "non-native." The trained model is then used to generate a speech clip that contains the content of a non-native speech clip, with the accent of a native speech clip, by applying a neural style transfer algorithm.
